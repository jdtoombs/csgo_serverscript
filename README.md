# CSGO Server Scripts - NOT AT ALL FUNCTIONAL YET
Plugins for Counter Strike FFA DM server.
# buymenu.sp
This script's goal is to allow the user to type !guns in chat that will then display a menu with a selction of weapons. Pressing the corresponding button should give the user the gun requested, or if they are currently in play - on next respawn. 
# Todo
- if currently holding item replace with chosen one from menu
- when user types !guns in chat have it run sm_test in console
- Leaderboard (timeplayed/hs), some sort of currency to reward players?
